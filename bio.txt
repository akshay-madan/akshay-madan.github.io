I am a Generative AI researcher with a Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and a B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and M.E. in Communication Engineering from BITS Pilani. I currently work as an AI Research Scientist at KVGAI Tech, where I lead the development of vision-language models for automated grading of student answer sheets. My work involves fine-tuning LLMs for rubric generation and evaluation, using a curated datasets built from domain-expert inputs and real classroom content.

My broader research focuses on AI agents, machine learning, and wireless signal processing for healthcare and IoT. I am developing multi-agent AI frameworks for smart homes and healthcare applications, combining generative AI with real-time sensing to enable proactive monitoring, activity recognition, and decision support in non-intrusive settings. My work has been published in IEEE Sensors Journal, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, Ad Hoc Networks, and IEEE MASS Conference, covering topics such as deep learning, WiFi CSI-based sensing, and digital contact tracing.

I was awarded the University of Pittsburgh Provostâ€™s Doctoral Completion Fellowship (2024) and contributed to a project funded by the Pitt Cyber Accelerator Grant for digital health innovation.
I have also served as a reviewer for several journals including IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Wireless Communications, Elsevier Computer Communications, and Wiley Software: Practice & Experience.
